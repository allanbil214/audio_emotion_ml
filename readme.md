# Speech Emotion Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a **Speech Emotion Detection** system using the **TESS dataset**. It compares three deep learning models: **LSTM, CNN, and CNN+LSTM** to classify emotions from speech data.

## 📌 Features
- **Preprocessing**: Converts raw audio into spectrogram features.
- **Models**: Implements and compares LSTM, CNN, and CNN+LSTM.
- **Evaluation**: Generates accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
- **Deployment**: The best model can be saved and converted for mobile deployment.

## 📂 Dataset
The **TESS (Toronto Emotional Speech Set)** dataset consists of speech recordings labeled with emotions. More details can be found [here](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/24487).
